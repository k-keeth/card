It's me, Keeth Kuwahara!

# Usage

## npm
```
npx k-kuwahara
```

## GitHub Package Registry
Assuming you have the GitHub registry set up, you can use via npx:
```
npx @k-kuwahara/card
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
